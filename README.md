# Hello-world

My name is Jacob, just doing some practice here trying to make sense of all this while listening to some old school techno, which sounds awesome by the way incase you don't know because you are stuck in the modern world of digitally produced music which is very unoriginal by the way. But hey that's just my opinion.
Laters.
